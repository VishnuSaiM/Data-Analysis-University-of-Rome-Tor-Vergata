Data Analysis and Visualization of pre-5G vs. 5G Exposure
 Analyzed long-term trends of electric field and power exposure in pre-5G vs. 5G environments.
 Predicted 5G exposure trends and compared them with pre-5G exposure, computing hourly average power and
electric field values. Utilized MATLAB for computational analysis and data visualization.
